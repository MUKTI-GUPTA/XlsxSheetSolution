# Real-Life Problem: Bulk Employee Onboarding in a Company

## Scenario  
A company hires **hundreds of new employees** every month and needs to generate **personalized offer letters, ID cards, or resumes** for them. Manually creating these documents for each employee is:  

- **Time-consuming**: HR teams must enter details for every individual.  
- **Error-prone**: Manual data entry can lead to mistakes in names, salaries, or job roles.  
- **Inefficient**: Updating documents for corrections or re-issuing is cumbersome.  

## Solution Using an Excel (XLSX) Sheet  
HR maintains an **Excel sheet** with employee details (**Name, Email, Job Role, Salary**, etc.). A script then:  

1. **Reads the Excel file** to fetch employee details.  
2. **Generates personalized documents** (offer letters, ID cards, or resumes) in bulk using **templates**.  
3. **Converts them into PDFs** and **sends them automatically via email**.  

This **saves time, reduces errors, and ensures uniformity**, making onboarding **faster and more efficient**. 🚀


### how to use 
1. npm install
2. add the xlsx sheet and link there address in js file
3. run - node generate_resumes.js / npm start
4. the resultant pdf will be added on resume folder

- happy coding </>
